2，进度：Engineering: Networking, 1-0 to 1-3

3，学习的内容有:
Unit 1: The Internet and IP
1-0: The Internet and IP
    What is the Internet and what is the Internet Address?
    Data->packets

1-1: A day in the life of an application
    Example 1: the world wide web
        client-server mode
    Example 2: BitTorrent
        peer-to-peer mode
    Example 3: Skype
        (NAT) Network address translator
        Rendezous server: reverse connection
        Relay server

1-2: The 4 layer Internet model
    The link layer: to carry the data over one link at a time.
        Deliver packet, hop-by-hop.
        eg. Ethernet, WiFi.
    The network layer: to deliver packets (datagrams) end-to-end across the Internet from the source to the destination.
        Use the Internet Protocol (IP): no promises, no guarantees.
    The transport layer: guarantees the correct in-order delivery of data.
        TCP
        UDP: offers no delivery guarantees.
    The application layer: bi-directional reliable byte stream between 2 apps, using application-specific semantics.

1-3: The IP service model
    IP services:
        datagram (individually routed packets, hop-by-hop routing),
        unreliable,
        best effort (drop packets if only necessary),
        connectionless.
    Why is the IP service so simple?
        Simple, dumb, minimal.
        The end-to-end principle: implement features in the end hosts.
        Allows a variety of reliable (or not) services to be built on top.
        Works over any link layer.
    IP service model:
        Prevent packets from looping forever. (TTL field, time to live.)
        Fragment packets if they are too long (for the link layer).
        Reduce chances of delivering datagrams to wrong destination (using a header checksum).
        IPv4, IPv6.
        Allows for new options to be added to header.
    IPv4 datagram.
