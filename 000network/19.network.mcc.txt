1，总时间 2.5 小时

2，进度：Engineering: Networking, 1-4 to 1-5

3，学习的内容有:
Unit 1: The Internet and IP
1-4: A day in the life of a packet
    Transport layer: 3 way handshake
        client->server: SYN
        server->client:SYN-ACK
        client->server:ACK
    Network layer: delivering packets to computers (data sent to different aoolications on the same computer looks the same)
    Transport layer: delivering data to applications
    To open a TCP stream to another program need:
        IP address (network layer, data to computer)
        TCP port (transport layer, data to applications)
    Tools:
        Wireshark: to see TCP byte stream establishment and data exchange
        Traceroute: to see route packets take through Internet

1-5: The principle of packet switching
    Packet:
        A self-contained unit of data that carries information necessary for it to reach its destination.
    Packet switching:
        Independently for each arriving packet, pick its outgoing link. If the link is free, send it. Else hold the packet for later.
    Self routing = source routing -> may have secure issues.
    Nice properties of packet switching:
        Simple packet forwarding.
        Efficient sharing of links.
