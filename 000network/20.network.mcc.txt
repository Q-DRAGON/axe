1，总时间 2.5 小时

2，进度：Engineering: Networking, 1-6 to 1-8

3，学习的内容有:
Unit 1: The Internet and IP
1-6: The principle of layering
    Reasons for layering
        Modularity (more manageable)
        Well defined service (to the layer above)
        Reuse
        Separation of concerns
        Continuous improvement
        peer-to-peer communications (specific to layered communication systems)

1-7: The principle of encapsulation
    Encaosulation: the principle unifies layering and packet.
    Encapsulated payloads:
        Help separation of concerns
        Help enforce boundaries / layering
        Simplify layer implementation
    TLS

1-8 Byte order and packet formats
    Little endian: The least significant byte comes first.
    Big endian: The most significant byte comes first.

4，掌握程度：完全理解。
